# Explanation
At the beginning, we loaded the whole set of data and we normalized every feature in a range between 0 and 5. The reason why we did it is that k-means does not work well with data from different scales. In order to normalize them, we used the logit function:
1 / (1 + exp(-value)) 
that transform the value in a range [0,1] and then we multiplied the result by 5.
