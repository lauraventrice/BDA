# Big Data Analytics project
Development of exercises for Big Data Analytics course at University of Luxembourg.

There were 4 exercises completed during the semester, each focusing on a different topic on which to apply big data analysis techniques. Each of the exercises consisted of 3 problems.

The three problems proposed in the first exercise are as follows: 
- Modified Word Counting via the Java API of Hadoop using wikipedia articles.

- Modified Word Counting via the Scala API. 

- Analyzing Live Tweets via the Scala API of Spark. 



The three problems proposed in the second exercise are as follows: 
- Predicting Heart Diseases via Decision Trees & Random Forests with data set from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease .

- Weather Prediction via Regression Trees & Regression Forests with data set Integrated Surface Data (ISD) available at http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/ of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

- Recommender Systems via Matrix Factorization with AudioScrobbler dataset (http://www-ens.iro.umontreal.ca/~bergstrj/audioscrobbler_data.html)


The three problems proposed in the third exercise are as follows: 
- Latent Semantic Analysis of Wikipedia Movie Plots using “Wikipedia Movie Plots” dataset as it is available from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots .

- Outlier Detection for Gearbox Readings using the “Gearbox Fault Detection” dataset released by the NASA in 2009 and available
from Kaggle:

- Social Network Analysis in GraphX using the “Social networks: Twitter” dataset as it is available from the below URL:

The three problems proposed in the fourth exercise are as follows: 
- Geo-Spatial & Temporal Data Analysis using NYC taxi trips and NYC boroughs GeoJson data sets. 

- Analyzing Traffic Safety Data using “Motor Vehicle Collisions” open data collection (available from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/)

- Final Big Data Use-Case which was an exercise in which we were free to choose datasets and what type of analysis to perform. The datasets chosen were about Pokémon:
